Now I am going in depth about the ingredients. A confident shot means you can trust your shooting form. Lillard has perfected his form and that's one of the reasons why he can hit big-time shots. You need to trust your shot. No matter where. And the only way to trust it is to practice. Thousands of shots are needed to trust your shot. Good ball handling means you can handle the ball good enough to put pressure on the defense. I don't have the best ball handling, but it is good ennough to force pressure on defenders. Then, leadership. There is no way your coach or teammates will trust you with that shot unless you lead. You must be able to hit shots and deliver for you and your team for them to trust you at the end of the game. Finally, the Swagger. You might be asking what that is, but it really means Confidence and Will. When you are confident, al of your basketball skills open up. You become ungaurdable. And that is how Damian Lillard becomes... Dame Time!!!
